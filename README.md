Profanity Detection:
A program to detect the degree of profanity in a file of Twitter tweets, based on a set of specified words that indicate offensive language.

Requirements:
Python 3.x

Usage:
Clone or download the repository
Replace the placeholder ... in the code with a list of words that you consider to indicate offensive language.

Run the program with the following command in the terminal:
python profanity_detection.py <input_file> ,
where <input_file> is the path to the file containing the Twitter tweets.

Output:
The program outputs the degree of profanity for each sentence in the file, where the degree of profanity is calculated as the ratio of the number of offensive words to the total number of words in the sentence.

Assumptions:
The file containing the Twitter tweets is a plain text file with one tweet per line.
The specified words indicating offensive language are case-insensitive.
